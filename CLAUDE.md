# pie-extensions/core

## What this repo is

This is the **control plane** for the `pie-extensions` GitHub org. It manages all mirrored PHP extension repositories, making them installable via [PIE](https://github.com/php/pie) (the PECL replacement).

The org exists because not all PHP extensions have native PIE support yet. We mirror their releases and wrap them in PIE-compatible packaging so users can install them today.

## Repo responsibilities

- `registry.json` — source of truth listing all mirrored extensions
- GitHub Actions workflows that detect upstream releases and dispatch syncs to mirror repos
- Onboarding workflow to create new mirror repos from the template
- Health check workflow to detect stale or broken mirrors
- Scripts used by the workflows (Node.js, ES modules, requires Node >=20)

## What this repo does NOT do

- It does not contain extension source code (that lives in individual mirror repos)
- It does not build binaries (that's handled by `pie-extensions/mirror-action`)
- It does not publish to Packagist (that's manual per extension, documented below)

## registry.json schema

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    {
      "name": "redis",
      "mirror-repo": "pie-extensions/redis",
      "upstream-repo": "phpredis/phpredis",
      "upstream-type": "github",
      "packagist-name": "pie-extensions/redis",
      "packagist-registered": false,
      "php-ext-name": "redis",
      "status": "active",
      "added": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

`status` values: `active` | `stale` | `deprecated` | `needs-packagist`

## How syncing works

1. `check-upstreams.yml` runs daily via cron (05:00 UTC)
2. The `check` job runs `check-upstreams.js` — for each active extension in `registry.json`, it compares the latest upstream GitHub release tag against the latest tag in the mirror repo
3. Extensions with a newer upstream version are collected into a JSON list (output as `stale`)
4. If stale count > 0 and not a dry run, the `dispatch` job runs `dispatch-syncs.js` which fires `workflow_dispatch` on each stale mirror repo's `sync.yml` workflow
5. The mirror repo's workflow calls `pie-extensions/mirror-action` to do the actual sync, release, and optional binary build

## Adding a new extension

Run the onboarding workflow manually:

```
GitHub UI → Actions → Onboard Extension → Run workflow
  upstream-repo: phpredis/phpredis
  ext-name: redis
  php-ext-name: redis
```

This will:
1. Create `pie-extensions/redis` from the `extension-template` repo
2. Populate `.pie-mirror.yml` with upstream config
3. Update `composer.json` with extension metadata
4. Add the extension to `registry.json` via `add-to-registry.js`
5. Open a PR for the registry update
6. Optionally trigger an initial sync (default: true)

After merging the PR you must **manually register on Packagist** — this cannot be automated.

## Packagist registration (manual step)

1. Go to https://packagist.org/packages/submit
2. Enter the mirror repo URL: `https://github.com/pie-extensions/<name>`
3. Set up the GitHub webhook for auto-updates
4. Set `packagist-registered: true` in `registry.json`

## Local development

```bash
npm install
node scripts/check-upstreams.js --dry-run    # see what would be synced
node scripts/health-check.js                 # check all mirror repo states
```

Requires Node >=20 and `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var with `repo` and `workflow` scopes.

## Secrets required

| Secret                 | Used by                    | Purpose                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`         | all workflows              | default, auto-provided                |
| `PIE_COMPAT_BOT_TOKEN` | dispatch-syncs, onboarding | needs `workflow` scope on other repos |

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger workflows in other repos — `PIE_COMPAT_BOT_TOKEN` must be a PAT or GitHub App token with `workflow` scope set as an org secret.

### `PIE_COMPAT_BOT_TOKEN` fine-grained token permissions

The token needs access to **all repositories** in the `pie-extensions` org (it creates new repos, pushes to mirrors, and dispatches workflows on any mirror).

| Repository permission | Access       | Reason                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Administration**    | Read & Write | `repos.createUsingTemplate` — create new mirror repos from template    |
| **Contents**          | Read & Write | `repos.createOrUpdateFileContents` — write `.pie-mirror.yml` and `composer.json` in mirror repos |
| **Actions**           | Read & Write | `actions.createWorkflowDispatch` — trigger `sync.yml` on mirror repos  |
| **Pull requests**     | Read & Write | `peter-evans/create-pull-request` — open PRs on the core repo          |
| **Metadata**          | Read         | Required by all fine-grained tokens (auto-granted)                     |

> **Note:** `repos.createUsingTemplate` requires Administration write access. If GitHub's fine-grained token support doesn't cover this, use a classic PAT with `repo` + `workflow` scopes instead.
